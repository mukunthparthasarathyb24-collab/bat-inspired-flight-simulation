# Bat-Inspired Flapping Wing Simulation

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Honors Project on
physics-based simulation of bat-inspired flapping flight.

## Project Overview
Bats exhibit highly articulated wings supported by flexible membranes, allowing
complex unsteady aerodynamic force generation. This project aims to develop a
reduced-order simulation framework using Python and PyBullet that captures the
interaction between joint actuation, membrane deformation, and aerodynamic forces.

## Methodology
- Articulated wing model with shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints
- Torque-based PID control of joint motion
- Flexible membrane modeled using mass–spring systems
- Quasi-steady blade-element aerodynamic force computation
- Simulation implemented in PyBullet

## Current Status
- Literature review completed
- Project structure defined
- PyBullet basics and joint control under development

## Future Work
- Integration of membrane model
- Aerodynamic force validation
- Reinforcement learning based control
